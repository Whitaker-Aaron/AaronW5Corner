When I played Breath of the Wild 8 years ago, I viewed the world of Hyrule with pure novelty and wonder. 
Anticipating the title for years, and finally having the opportunity to take the first steps into the title that would go on to define the state of the video game industry for the next decade filled me with so much unadulterated joy. As time has waned, and the game's legacy has settled with a sequel that is now two years old, and a 4K rerelease on the Nintendo Switch 2, I find myself looking at this Hyrule from 2017 through a different lens. 

*Breath of the Wild is no longer a novelty* 

A world so steeped in the elation of discovery finds difficulty offering a reason to retread that ground. Astounded by the visual performance of Breath of the Wild with 4k and HDR, 
I took it upon myself to rediscover that world anyways. However, little discovery was to be found. After completing Tears of the Kingdom last year, I found myself at ends with this iteration of Hyrule. Everything to offer from it, had been offered. And as a result, I viewed this playthrough of Breath of the Wild as a victory lap, rather than a journey. 

And to my surprise it felt more comforting than I had expected.

 # "There is a *sudden stillness* to Breath of the Wild."

 Tears of the Kingdom offers a version of Hyrule that is mired in a constant pull of your attention. There is always a visual indictator of something to do, places to explore and enemies to kill. Breath of the Wild conversely, uses the simplicity of its ruinous environment to place small visual pulls in the form of shrines and towers, to guide you softly, but not completely avert your attention. Your attention, then, is directed to the atmosphere, the sudden stillness. 

 For all intents and purposes, the Hyrule of Breath of the Wild is dead. It died 100 years ago, and Link essentially along with it. The rediscovery of Link's memories is Breath of the Wild's status quo, h
