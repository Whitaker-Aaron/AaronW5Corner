When I played Breath of the Wild 8 years ago, I viewed the world of Hyrule with pure novelty and wonder.
Anticipating the title for years, and finally having the opportunity to take the first steps into the title that would go on to define the state of the video game industry for the next decade filled me with so much unadulterated joy. As time has waned, and the game's legacy has settled with a sequel that is now two years old, and a 4K rerelease on the Nintendo Switch 2, I find myself looking at this Hyrule from 2017 through a different lens.





*Breath of the Wild is no longer a novelty*. A world so steeped in the elation of discovery finds difficulty offering a reason to retread that ground. Astounded by the visual performance of Breath of the Wild with 4k and HDR, I took it upon myself to rediscover that world anyways. However, little discovery was to be found. After completing Tears of the Kingdom last year, I found myself at ends with this iteration of Hyrule. Everything to offer from it, had been offered. And as a result, I viewed this playthrough of Breath of the Wild as a victory lap, rather than a journey.


And to my surprise it felt more comforting than I had expected.

 # There is a *sudden stillness* to Breath of the Wild.


 Tears of the Kingdom offers a version of Hyrule that is mired in a constant pull of your attention. There is always a visual indictator of something to do, places to explore and enemies to kill. Breath of the Wild conversely, uses the simplicity of its ruinous environment to place small visual pulls in the form of shrines and towers, to guide you softly, but not completely avert your attention. Your attention, then, is directed to the atmosphere, the sudden stillness.


For all intents and purposes, the Hyrule of Breath of the Wild is dead. It died 100 years ago, and Link essentially along with it. The rediscovery of Link's memories is Breath of the Wild's status quo, consistently placing the player in situations that allow them to learn the history of the world they now walk. Environments are the biggest vehicle for this discovery; scattered ruins showing the kingdom that once was, and the quaint settlements that remain to further the narrative missing inbetween. What’s fascinating about Breath of the Wild’s inhabitants is that they vary in race, some races touting long lifespans with the Zora, and some with average human longevity such as with the Hylians. This helps creates a dynamic where some carry strong resentment and remorse having lived through the calamity, and those who are merely descendants of those who experienced the event. As the player you’re expected to put the pieces together from these tribes, being given anecdotes of the life Link lived 100 years prior, and seeing the ruin that followed. Many will disparage Breath of the Wild’s reduced story, but in reality the story is told in a different manner.

There is nothing explicitly given to the player; if they want to finish the campaign of Breath of the Wild as quickly as they can, they are given the option. This allows the freedom of choice, and the freedom to dig into as much or as little narrative as the player desires. Finding these characters in the world, choosing to chase the memories, opting to solve the modern problems that plague Hyrule; they are all options to immerse oneself in a world that had been destroyed and is awaiting a hero. Coming back to Breath of the Wild, with the knowledge of this world and everything that has happened to it; having the omnipotent knowledge and no longer having the wonder of discovery, I questioned how much the game would have to offer me anymore. A game so rooted in first-time discovery, what was left to even enjoy? 


Breath of the Wild’s campaign is relatively short; each of the four story sections takes no longer than two hours, letting the bulk of the game remain composed of traversal around Hyrule, with towers and shrines being the main elements of attraction. Having played through Breath of the Wild twice, with Tears of the Kingdom also still fresh in my memory, traversing this Hyrule once more felt routine. 


I would make my way off the Great Plateau, head to Kakariko Village and seek Impa, find some shrines on the way, then tackle the Divine Beasts in any order I saw fit. The journey through the world no longer felt like a journey, it felt like a walk through childhood streets.

And I think that memory of returning home; that feeling of being in a familiar place is what Breath of the Wild will live on as in my mind. I value replaying games that I love, because to me they are items of comfort. A sense of escapism into a world I know I can enjoy, if I elect to. Breath of the Wild has always seemed at odds with this approach though, a game so bent on delivering its enjoyment through the blind experience. But I don’t think games always need to be enjoyed the way they’re intended to. Perhaps that’s the beauty of the medium. As I took in the HDR beaming sunsets and the beautiful blue glow of the Sheikah technology, I felt at peace in a way. The playthrough at some point stopped being a small romp to marvel at the game’s better performance on new hardware, and started being a meditative few hours of my day. After playing Tears of the Kingdom, I grew burnt out from the title’s necessity to always overwhelm the player with decisions. But Breath of the Wild simply asks the player to exist at times. Take in the air; the environs. With an upgrade that no longer needs to let the world come at a reduced frame rate or compromise for display, I started to appreciate Breath of the Wild differently. I no longer saw it was a world to explore, but a world to just return to as a means of decompressing.

 # Context Changes Perception.


One of the big pulls of returning to Breath of the Wild on the Nintendo Switch 2 was the inclusion of a mobile app that tracked your location in game. I found little value in having a secondary screen with a map, but what I did find interest in was the addition of new lore in the form of voice memories. These memories act as fully voiced entries, presented by Zelda in a state just before the calamity strikes. They're able to be digested as diary entries, simply requiring the player to be present at the location that Zelda herself would've been at when documenting the entry. There are genuinely interesting details of information to be explored in these entries; adding context to much of the world that lay in ruins that would've otherwise been left to the imagination of the player. One of the protruding carvings in Hebra mountain is theorized to be an energy blast from ancient times; the founding of the stable association is laid bare as a means to prepare for the calamity; ruins in the Gerudo Desert are surmized to have been destroyed by Moldugas in a war, having existed as towns previously, aiding the narrative of the Imprisioning War told in Tears of the Kingdom. The world of Hyrule is able to be viewed through a different lens, because so much context surrounding this world has changed. Tears of the Kingdom explores this Hyrule at its inception, showing the rise and seal of Ganondorf, and the culture of the Zonai who civilized the world.

As a player who had experienced Tears of the Kingdom, looking at Breath of the Wild's iteration of Hyrule no longer evoked the same feelings. It didn't carry the same air of mystery, yet I was able to appreciate it on a different scale due to this increased state of knowledge. Coupled with the voice memories, some of which leaning into plot points that would go on to be addressed in Tears of the Kingdom, Breath of the Wild started to feel like the first step in a much grander story. This grander story shifts how I've started to perceive both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom. I've long held onto the sentiment that Breath of the Wild had felt like a fulfilling experience, but not a complete one. Rather, Breath of the Wild does not end on a note where the player feels like they've accomplished the last feat in a massive overarching narrative. The ending, feels like the first step forward. As the player you've come to experience the history, the cultures and the events that lead up to the awakening and restoration of this iteration of Hyrule, but not much has transpired during that awakening. Throughout the entire course of Breath of the Wild, the experience is akin to being caught up to speed in a melancholic exploration of a ruined world. But at the roll of the credits, there is this feeling of having more left to do. Zelda as much states so; with her acknowledgment that Hyrule needs to be rebuilt and maintained to honor the legacy of those who gave everything. But for the 6 years that transpired between Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, this was the ending that fans would have to sit with and accept. 

No longer though, does Breath of the Wild find itself at this impasse, given you as the player have Tears of the Kingdom in your possession. Now, this Hyrule feels home to a duology, a story that uses the medium to deliver its narrative. If Breath of the Wild are the first steps to recovering this Hyrule, then Tears of the Kingdom is the sprint to finalize that recovery. I think the reuse of Breath of the Wild's Hyrule in Tears of the Kingdom aids the nagging feeling left at Breath of the Wild's end. So much of Breath of the Wild is spent just understanding the history and culture of the world, but not making much progress in developing the broken country apart from recovering the Divine Beasts and sealing the Calamity. Now, with the context of Tears of the Kingdom, playing through Breath of the Wild feels like a solid couple hours of discovery to ease into the messiness of Tears of the Kingdom. This lets both games complement each other nicely. They are allowed to exist to the state that they are because both titles attempt to cover the other's weaknesses. 

There doesn't really exist a sense of incompleteness anymore. Breath of the Wild is allowed to maintain its purity; an adventure to truly take in a world stilled in time, with its ending being a foreboding approach towards a grander battle to be had in Tears of the Kingdom, rather than a deflating longing for something more complete. Breath of the Wild is now forever the calm before the storm, and it helps me appreciate the narrative that much more.

 # Coming to Terms.

 As time passes, our memories and association with things from our past becomes perhaps tinted by nostalgia or a longing for simpler times. I often associate Breath of the Wild with these memories because its release was not only something I had anticipated for years prior, but also coincided with a turning point in my life. Living in Breath of the Wild's world evoked such a sense of awe, one that I've never been able to quite replicate even with the eventual sequel in Tears of the Kingdom. However, maybe replaying Breath of the Wild doesn't need to evoke this feeling every time. Maybe appreciating it for its legacy; enjoying the added context and buildup of the story that would come after, is enough.

 I feel as though I've come to terms with Breath of the Wild. As in, I've gotten everything I'll ever want out of it. This Hyrule, is more or less, complete. As of the time of writing this piece, *Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment* has yet to release, however I view the Warriors titles more as supplemental "what-if" scenarios, rather than valid entries in the compendium of Zelda's lore. With the release of every Zelda game, they view heavy conversation and discussion on launch. A new Zelda game leaves itself on a pedestal of being compared and critiqued to the ones that came prior, with talking points always trying to dissect what the new does wrong to not honor the legacy of the old. Breath of the Wild met this fate for a long time, and Tears of the Kingdom extended the conversation even further. However, as of now, I feel that Breath of the Wild is no longer contemporary. With this last playthrough, I felt like I was walking a legacy, rather than expericing a novelty. The experience started to cement itself similar to retreads of Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess. While this feeling should've been expected, I suppose I found it surprising. Breath of the Wild has been touted for so long as the pushing standard for the industry, but now, it had started to feel dated, and nostalgic. Zelda and Link's story, as they are in Breath of the Wild's iteration, was told. And all that remained was the experience to look back on and relive through informed replays. 

 What remains now, is looking towards the future of The Legend of Zelda. Tears of the Kingdom, while a technical marvel of a title, was Breath of the Wild's finishing act, rather than a fundamentally new installment in the franchise. Using both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom as a base, its fascinating to ponder what could come next for the franchise, especially on hardware as capable as the Nintendo Switch 2. Forever and always, The Legend of Zelda will have a lasting legacy in my memories as a franchise that continues to inspire and fill me with joy. With a new generation of Nintendo, the Wild era of the Legend of Zelda can rest, as the definitive versions of each title have been released. With their conclusion, it feels like the ending of a chapter that has permeated discussion and culture for so long, fundamentally reinventing how people would perceive the Zelda franchise. Coming back to Breath of the Wild from here on out, will be a walk down memory lane, and I feel as though we can let these titles rest, and move on to something even grander. That's the cyclical nature of genre defining games, and it's something I'm appreciative to have been able to experience.

 Laying the final arrow of light through Dark Beast Ganon and seeing the ghosts of the departed Champions scatter to the wind, I felt a synonymous feeling of Breath of the Wild finally being laid to rest in my mind. I was ready to move on, and I'm eager for what awaits in the future.
